# DM BikeShare

![](C:\Users\lrinc\DataAustin2020\bikesharing\images\bikes.JPG)

The DM Bike sharing business that we want to start in Des Moines would be a remarkable business to start as it would allow locals and tourists to take advantage of borrowing a bike for short-term trips at a low-cost. Based on our analysis, the bikes would be stationed in docks at the most popular pedestrian zones in the city such as plazas, courtyards, downtown, and at all major tourist attractions. It is not only a flexible transportation serivce, but it also has health benefits and it helps the environment by reducing energy use and emissons in the transport sector.

## New York City Trip

Our idea to start the business in Des Moines, came after a trip to NeW York City. We used citBike to bike everywhere and that allowed us to get to know the city more and interact with people who live there who also use the bikes for their commutes.

## Why Would The Bike-Sharing Program Work?

We understand that as investors you want to know that this program will would work here in Des Moines as it does in New York City. We have done extensive research and confirmed that there are several reasons why it would. We created a Tableau Story [link to dashboard] () specifically detailing how **Gender Diversity** can be a challenge and how we will overcome it.

1. We will start by giving you the percent of gender diversity in Des Moines?

<center>

|Female|Male|
|:------:|:----:|
|51%|49%

</center>

2. How does it compare to the gender diversity in New York City?

<center>

|Female|Male|Unknown|
|:------:|:----:|:---:|
|25%|65%|10%|

</center>

3. What effect does it have on possible business in Des Moines?
- Although there's **26%** more females in Des Moines than in New York City and **16%** less males, according to research, the gap between men and women's bicycling participation isn't so large. Based on a survey it has been found that of the people who ride bikes, 43% are women and 57% are men. (Braker, Sarah. *"New Resarch On Women's Bicycling Participation Reveals Insights-And Some Surprises"*. 28 May 2015. https://peopleforbikes.org. 7 Septmeber 2020.)

- Therefore having almost a 50/50 gender diversity will not have a great impact on the bike-sharing program.
